My academic background is in physics and applied mathematics and my research interests are geared toward the development of mesh and mesh-free codes for development solving coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) for large scale multiphysics frameworks that can be applied in biological, atmospheric, and astrophysical phenomena. 
Currently I am working on a coupled mesh-free/mesh PDE framework with my advisor Professor Grady Wright in the Mathematics Department at Boise State University, by ultilization of Radial Basis Function 
  Finite Differences (RBF-FD) and Spectral Element Methods (SEM).
Some of my previous work has been computational fluid dynamics simulations of pebble bed nuclear reactor heat transfer using the finite volume framework OpenFOAM. 
I have also co-authored papers and presented work on active galaxy evolution by bridging gap between large scale cosmological simulations  and observational data from the Fermi Space Telescope and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with ideas from the spin gap-paradigm .
